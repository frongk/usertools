# usertools
This is a tool to look up tilde.town users and determine when their frequent activity occurs using the userlogs. 
Python dependencies are numpy and pandas. I could not install pandas in python's virtual environment so this will
be an issue to address in future commits. Makes use of vis.js for visualizations.
